## How to Read Paper

### Three-Pass

#### First: Read briefly

* title
* abstract
* introduction
* conclusion
* reference

**Then find keys**
* category
* context
* corrections
* contribution
* clarity

**Purpose**: filter useless papers

#### Second: Further reading

* figures, diagrams or other illustration
* mark relevant unread references

**Purpose**: Can summarize the main thoughts. This step satisfies that you are just interested in it. If you don't understand what the paper says, there are three methods:
 * let it be
 * read background material 
 * to the third step

#### Third: Reading in detail

* virtually reimplement the paper 
  * make same assumptions
  * recreate works
* make the ideas and methods in your mind.

**Purpose**: Reconstruct the entire structure and identity the strong and weak ideas. Also, you can find out what is wrong.


#### The whole line
* Finding related papers through the keys, more recently luckier. Reading them in the first step, make a thumbnail summary
* Finding shared citations and repeated author names, which are key papers and researchers in this area. Pay attention to Where they publish papers. This will help you identify the top conferences in this area.
* Use the conferences you just find, and make a quick scan of the high-quality papers(make two steps) in your work. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, obtain and read it, iterating as necessary.
